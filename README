Vagrantfile and bash provisioning script for centos/7 from upstream

 - this sets up a GNOME Desktop with virtual box guest additions

To run:

 - download the current box, unfortunately CentOS doesn't release monthly to hashicorp/atlas

   vagrant box add \
          http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/vagrant/x86_64/images/CentOS-7-Vagrant-1509-x86_64-01.box \
          --name centos/7-1509

 - copy the Vagrantfile and provision.sh script into a subdirectory
       (if you use a different box version above, edit your command and Vagrantfile to match)

 - cd into that subdirectory

 - do a 'vagrant up' which will create the DVD drive and start provisioning.

 - when you see the VirtualBox gui, click Devices->InsertGuestAdditions CD Image
    before the system starts provisioning.  The provisioning script needs it later.

 - the provision script will bring the system up to a GNOME Desktop level
    and set the system to a graphical target runlevel for the next reboot.

 - you can login as vagrant and 'startx', or alternately just reboot to bring
    the system up in a graphical desktop mode, fully configured and updated.
    The provision.sh script here takes the reboot for you currently...

Notes:
  - shared drag'n'drop and cut'n'paste are enabled via the Vagrantfile
  - the provision script installs Xwindows and reboots at the end of provisioning (comment out/edit to taste)

Debugging notes:

 - kernel updates can be problematic and sometimes you will get a message saying
    the VBoxAdditions kernel service is not running.  In 'general' this is a mismatch
    this can be fixed by rebooting to come up on the updated kernel, then reinstalling
    the virtual box additions.   A reboot after that is not required, but is generally
    a good idea to verify the system boots cleanly after initial provisioning.
