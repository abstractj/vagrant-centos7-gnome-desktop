Vagrantfile and bash provisioning script for centos/7 from upstream

 - this sets up a GNOME Desktop with virtual box guest additions


To run:

 - do a 'vagrant up' which will create the DVD drive and start provisioning.

 - when you see the VirtualBox gui, click Devices->InsertGuestAdditions CD Image
    before the system starts provisioning.  The provisioning script needs it later.

 - the provision script will bring the system up to a GNOME Desktop level
    and set the system to a graphical target runlevel for the next reboot.

 - you can login as vagrant and 'startx', or alternately just reboot to bring
    the system up in a graphical desktop mode, fully configured and updated.


Note: remember to enable shared cut+paste to/from the host via
	Devices->SharedClipboard->Bidirectional in the gui  
      similiarly you might want to enable drag'n'drop also via Devices





Debugging notes:

 - kernel updates can be problematic and sometimes you will get a message saying
    the VBoxAdditions kernel service is not running.  In 'general' this is a mismatch
    this can be fixed by rebooting to come up on the updated kernel, then reinstalling
    the virtual box additions.   A reboot after that is not required, but is generally
    a good idea to verify the system boots cleanly after initial provisioning.
